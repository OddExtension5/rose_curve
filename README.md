# ROSE CURVE

In mathematics, a rose or rhodonea curve is a sinusoid specified by either the cosine or sine functions with no phase angle that is plotted in polar coordinates. 
Rose curves or "rhodonea" were named by the Italian mathematician who studied them, Guido Grandi, between the years 1723 and 1728.

A rose is the set of points in polar coordinates specified by the polar equation
$$r=a\cos(k\theta )$$ or in Cartesian coordinates using the parametric equations


$${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=r\cos(\theta )=a\cos(k\theta )\cos(\theta )\end{aligned}}} $$

$${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}y&=r\sin(\theta )=a\cos(k\theta )\sin(\theta )\end{aligned}}} $$

Roses can also be specified using the sine function. Since
$${\displaystyle \sin(k\theta )=\cos \left(k\theta -{\frac {\pi }{2}}\right)=\cos \left(k\left(\theta -{\frac {\pi }{2k}}\right)\right)}$$

Thus, the rose specified by r = a sin(kθ) is identical to that specified by r = a cos(kθ) rotated counter-clockwise by $π/2k$ radians, which is one-quarter the period of either sinusoid.

+ Roses specified by the sinusoid r = cos(kθ) for various rational numbered values of the angular fr.equency k = n/d.
+ Roses specified by r = sin(kθ) are rotations of these roses by one-quarter period of the sinusoid in a counter-clockwise direction about the pole (origin). 
+ For proper mathematical analysis, k must be expressed in irreducible form.

## The limaçon trisectrix
A rose with k = 1/3 is a limaçon trisectrix that has the property of trisectrix curves that can be used to trisect angles.

#### The 8 petals of the rose with k = 4/5 (n = 4, d = 5) is each, a single loop that intersect other petals.
